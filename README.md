# Web-ETL-Suite
Web-ETL-Suite is a collection of Python ETL pipelines that scrape data from archived web pages, transform it into clean formats, and load it into CSV, JSON, and databases. A hands-on toolkit to turn messy web data into structured, usable datasets â€” one script at a time. Web data doesn't stay messy for long, not with this Python-powered ETL suite.
