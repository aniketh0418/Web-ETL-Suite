# 🧩 Web-ETL-Suite

Web-ETL-Suite is a collection of Python ETL pipelines that scrape data from archived web pages, transform it into clean formats, and load it into CSV, JSON, and databases. A hands-on toolkit to turn messy web data into structured, usable datasets — one script at a time. Web data doesn't stay messy for long, not with this Python-powered ETL suite.

## 📦 Contents

Each subfolder is a self-contained ETL project with its own script, README, and output files:

### 🔹 [`Top50-Movies-Scraper`](Top50-Movies-Scrapper)
Scrapes the Top 50 most highly ranked films from an archived webpage, stores them in a DataFrame, and saves to CSV and SQLite.

### 🔹 [`MultiFormat-ETL-Pipeline`](MultiFormat-ETL-Pipeline)
Reads and consolidates data from multiple file formats (CSV, JSON, XML), transforms it, and loads it into a unified CSV. Demonstrates flexible data ingestion.

### 🔹 [`Global-GDP-ETL-Pipeline`](Global-GDP-ETL-Pipeline)
Extracts country-wise nominal GDP data from an archived Wikipedia page, converts values from millions to billions, and stores the data in multiple formats.

### 🔹 [`Global-Banks-ETL`](Global-Banks-ETL)
Scrapes the largest banks by market capitalization, applies currency conversion using custom exchange rates, and runs SQL queries for insights.

### 🔹 [`CSV-to-SQLite-Loader`](CSV-to-SQLite-Loader)
Demonstrates how to load a CSV file into a SQLite database using Python and `pandas`. It also shows how to run SQL queries on the database table using Python.
